Description: This package provides data-adaptive estimation and inference using Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) in order to assess the causal effect of interventions on a single time-series. In particular, it implements two target parameters of the conditional distribution, indexed by the fixed-dimensional summary measure of the past up until the time point of interest.
